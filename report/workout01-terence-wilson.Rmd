####INTRODUCTION
Basketball is a sport beloved by much of the US, as well as some of the rest
of the world, although they would rather watch men kick balls than fondle
balls. Many of the fans of this sport (a group of fans to which I most
definitely do not belong) love to engross themselves in meaningless
statistics put up by a bunch of sweaty guys bumping into each other
whilst attempting to put a large orange ball through a hoop which is
unreasonably high. Personally I have no interest in such meaningless
statistics; Even so, I have somehow found myself in posession of an array of
statistics about one of the few things I have no interest in, and my boss
will likely fire me after learning what is going on here. Hopefully I can
get a job at buzzfeed after this. In any case, the shooting percentages of
some of the Golden State Warriors have been obtained and analyzed, and
apparently some of the data is somewhat interesting.



####MOTIVATION
Someone was motivated to bring this data together, likely compiling thousand
of different datasets, or maybe a few, but in the end a few dataframes which
reveal shooting statistics were squeezed out of the data. Many reasons aside
from personal motivation may havecontributed to the analysis of this data.
For instance, it would be worthwhile knowing who tends to shoot three point
shots, two point shots, or go in for the dunk or layup. This kind of
analysis would lend a meager advantage to tthe person who has seen the data,
because with such data one could arrange a team such that a player, or multiple players even, are locked down for a small portion of the game,
meaning that they are unable to perform optimally. This dataset could also
simply reveal the biggest scorers on ateam, which is an obvious advantage
since that would mean that one who posesses this data can likely analyze
who it is most worth for their team to guard, and who can be reasonably
left alone. 

####BACKGROUND
I will be completely honest and say that I do not know what background
refers to in this context. Am I supposed to reveal backgrounds on the
players and why these statistics may line up with how the players are
playing in game? I really dont know anything about most of these player
except that Kevin Durant has unreasonably long feet. I understand that he
is a tall dude and tall dudes have big feet, but his feet are long and
skinny, like stilletto knives. What reason have they to be that way? what
is the background? And while I have the question in my mind, could
background just mean the background of these statistics? Likely a bunch of
nerds compiled the statistics after watching four thousand games, and I did
the analysis with code in a few hours. Maybe I am supposed to go over the
background of statistics in general? I am not a mathematical historian,
though, so likely that will not work.

####DATA
The data is an amalgamation of all of the shooting statistics one could
glean from these players for each individual shot. these include what kind
of shot(three point, and two point), what action was used to make the shot
(dunking, layup, jump shot, etc.), whether the shot actually made it into
the basket, and even the x and y coordinates of the shots. These
coordinates are displayed in the image above, one for each player analyzed.
These individual data points were then combined into a visual
representation of the data, as well as a tabular representation so they
could be further analyzed.


####ANALYSIS
Upon analysis of the data one starts to see patterns which arise in the
players shooting tendencies. This is another thing which might be useful
for some adversary to have when trying to defend against these players. In
any case, analysis reveals that some players not only haver certain
shooting tendencies, but they also tend to miss or make more shots, as well
as how many overall shots they make. Above you can see that some players
have a higher make rate, but their over all shot count is so low that
having a slightly higher make percentage is not enough to set them above
the other players who simply have insane shooting numbers over all. Another
statistic which would have been fun to analyze is the shooting action
statistic. with this one could actually analyze what kinds of shots are
being made and by whom. This would likely reveal the most about the
behavior of the athletes, and woud likely provide the most useful
information to adversaries. If you know someone is going to try to make a
layup for fifty percent of their shots, then you are likely to actively
defend against that even if they are a big scorer.


####DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION
These kinds of analysis (the ones mentioned above) could provide
significant advantages to adversaries given they are ok with going over all
of the analyzed data and using it to form a strategy. It would actually be
nice to do an analysis of the kinds of shots being made, because I believe
that provides the most meaningful and valuable data. Data over a longer
period of time would also be more revealing, as you would be able to track
the progress of players and have even more accurate totals on all of the
statistics shown above. Unfortunately that is currently unavailable, or is
it? There were too many different Kinds of shots, however I did find the
minutes left works! here is a cool chart showing the relative positoin and
time of shots.
