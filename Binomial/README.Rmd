## Overview

`"Binomial"` is an [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package that contains functions which allow one to calculate various binomial distribution factors.

  - `bin_choose(trials, number)` calculates how many combinations of number length in trials trials. 
  - `bin_probability(success, trials, prob)` calculates the probability of the nuber of successes given a number of trials and probability of success.
  - `bin_distribution(trials, prob)` creates a `"bindis"` object of individual probabilities which can be plotted using `plot()`. This outputs a barchart.
  - `bin_cumulative(trials, prob)`creates a `"bincum"` object of the total probabilities which can be plotted using `plot()`. This outputs a point-lineplot.
  - `bin_variable(trials, prob)` creates a `"binvar"` object which contains the trials and probability of a binomial distribution. This object has the methods `print()` and `summary()` which give basic features of the binomial distribution.

## Motivation

I need a grade for this project.

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub via the package
`"devtools"`:

``` r
# development version from GitHub:
#install.packages("devtools") 

# install "binomial" (without vignettes)
devtools::install_github("Qui11sh/binomial")

# install "binomial" (with vignettes)
devtools::install_github("Qui11sh/binomial", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Usage

``` r
library(binomial)
```
